        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Try an authentic version of this classic Chinese takeaway dish, with natural sweetness and a warm chilli flavour to spice things up</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>sunflower or vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>100ml soda water, chilled</li>
            <li>140g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>25g cornflour</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>spring onions, finely shredded, to serve</li>
            <li>1 red pepper, deseeded and chopped into chunks
            </li>
            <li>3 red chillies, 1 cut into chunks, 2 halved and deseeded
            </li>
            <li>425g can pineapple chunks, drained and juice reserved</li>
            <li>4 star anise</li>
            <li>50g tamarind paste</li>
            <li>100g caster sugar</li>
            <li>100ml rice wine vinegar or Chinese vinegar
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the sauce, put the red pepper, chunks of chilli and pineapple juice in a pan and bring to the boil. Cover and cook for 10 mins, then pur√©e in a food processor. Return to the pan with the pineapple chunks, chilli halves, star anise, tamarind, sugar and vinegar. Gently simmer for 20-30 mins until reduced and sticky. Keep warm, or reheat to serve.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pan 1cm deep with oil and heat until shimmering. Whisk the soda water and 100ml cold water into the self-raising flour with a little salt. Tip the cornflour onto a plate, line a tray with kitchen paper and turn on the oven to low.</li>
            <li>Stir the batter well. Dust the chicken with cornflour, then dip into the batter. One at a time, lower into the hot oil (about 5-6 every batch). Turn up the heat to keep the chicken frying, if needed, and cook for 5-6 mins, turning once. When cooked, drain on the tray, and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Stack onto a plate with the warm sauce on the side, and scatter with shredded spring onions.</li>
