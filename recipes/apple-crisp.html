        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Try this moreish apple crisp. ‘Crisp’ is the American version of a crumble, with the topping a mix between a nutty flapjack and a traditional British crumble.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100g plain flour</li>
            <li>50g rolled oats</li>
            <li>50g flaked almonds or chopped pecans</li>
            <li>100g butter, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>50g light muscovado sugar</li>
            <li>½tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>vanilla ice cream or custard, to serve</li>
            <li>8 Cox's or Russet apples, peeled, cored and sliced into 5mm-thick rounds</li>
            <li>50g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>½ lemon, zested and juiced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put all the topping ingredients and a pinch of sea salt in a bowl and rub together with your fingers until combined into a crumb-like texture – this can also be done in a food processor. Chill until needed. Will keep chilled for up to two days.</li>
            <li>Toss the apples with the sugar and lemon zest and juice until evenly coated, and tip into a 23cm round baking dish that’s at least 5cm deep, or a 20cm square dish. Flatten down with your hand and scatter over the topping. Will keep covered and chilled for a day.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/ gas 5. Sit the crisp on a baking tray and bake for 40 mins until the topping is a deep golden and the fruit is bubbling at the edges. Leave to cool for 10 mins, then serve with ice cream or custard.</li>
        </ol>
